# amd64 function call inspector

An interactive inspector for the `amd64` sysv calling convetion.

Made as an excercise to get a better grip on it myself (and as a webdev exercise!).
If you sometimes struggle with picturing how and in which resgisters your arguments get passed to functions it might be worth playing around with it.

*NB, it's incomplete, rarely used types like `long double` aren't implemetned.*
